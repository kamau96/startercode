# 1. create a directory lab2_hdfs in your HDFS home directory



# 2. upload the files part-00000 through part-00003 into that directory 
# (you can find them on canvas)



# 3. move these files to a new HDFS directory called lab2_words



# 4. delete the lab2_hdfs directory



# 5. Display the last 1kb of the part-00002 file that you earlier put in HDFS



# 6. Display information about the filesize in blocks, replication information, 
# user name of the file owner, and modification date for the part-00001 file
# that you earlier put in HDFS
